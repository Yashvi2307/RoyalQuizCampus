# Royal quiz campus

This repository contains the source code for the quiz android application developed for [Royal Technosoft](https://royaltechnosoft.com/). Import the ```src```  folder into your android studio as an android project.

## Introduction

The reason we chose this project was to engage the young kids at [Royal Technosoft](https://royaltechnosoft.com/) especially during their mid-session breaks. 

## Modules
* Main module : Home screen
* Test module : Game page 
* Result module : Game won/ Play again

## Main Functionalities

This project has immensely helped the clients of Royal Technosoft (young kids) to check their GK. During the short breaks between the ongoing sessions this app acted as a good source of knowledge for the kids and also provided a playful environment to them. Quite often they would learn something new and compete with their peers. </br>
This activity also acted as an inspiration for the continuous process of learning and improving.

## Technologies used:
* Language: Java
* Database: SQLite

## Platform
Android

## Challenges
To make it a responsive design took a toll. We managed to have a breakpoint of 3 (i.e. for 3 devices), namely phone, tablet and watch.

## Improvements and Future Scope

* Extend the database to various freshly learned topics
* Include various levels in the game
* Make it hybrid

## Drawbacks

* Cannot create an account and store previous data
* Doesn't give a chance to continue once the players chooses an incorrect answer

## Other Details
1. Educational (General Knowledge quiz)
2. Correct answer +1 coin, Incorrect answer leads to "Play Again/ Quit"
3. 20second timer for each question
4. Random questions at each play
5. Can be played offline
6. Database to store questions
7. Native android app
8. Good and extensible UI
9. Compatible with Android API-15 and above
